## 4.1 Fundamentals.
 
* An expression is composed of one or more operands and yields a result when it is
evaluated. 
* unary binary tenary operators. 
* precedence and associativity

## 4.2 Arithemetic operators
1. m%n has the same sign as m
2. i % 2 == 0 ? "even" : "odd"
3. Overfflow

## 4.3 Logical and Relational operators

## 4.4 Assignment Operators

## 4.5 Increment and Decrement Operators

> Brevity is a virtue---making code more succint and less verbose.

## 4.6 The Member Access Operators

## 4.7 The Conditional Operator

## 4.8 The Bitwise Operator
1. The bitwise shift Operator >> <<
2. ~,^,&,|

## 4.9 The sizeof Operator
> The sizeof operator return the size ,in byte of an type name or exprssion
> The result is constant expression of the size_t
> sizeof(type)  sizeof expr

## 4.10 The Comma Operators

## 4.11 Type Conversions
1. Implicit conversion
2. Explicit conversion
 * static_cast--- larger arithmetic type is assigned to a smaller type
 * const_cast---change constness
 * interpre_cast---performs a low-level reinterpretation of the bit pattern of its operands
